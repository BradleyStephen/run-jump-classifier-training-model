This repository contains an AI model designed to classify whether an individual is running or jumping based on collected data. The data used for training the model was obtained using Phyphox, a smartphone application capable of recording various sensor data. The dataset, stored in CSV format, includes relevant sensor readings such as acceleration, orientation, and motion data.

The model training process was conducted using Python programming language and the Anaconda environment. Python provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks for machine learning, making it an ideal choice for developing and training AI models. Anaconda, a popular distribution for Python, offers a comprehensive environment that includes various scientific computing packages and tools required for efficient model development.

The AI model utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the collected CSV data and extract meaningful patterns related to running and jumping activities. Through the training process, the model has learned to distinguish between these two types of movements based on the captured sensor data patterns.

The Git repository serves as a central location for version control, collaboration, and sharing of the AI model and related code. It contains the necessary scripts, configuration files, and documentation to replicate the model training environment and deploy the trained model for further analysis or integration into other applications.
